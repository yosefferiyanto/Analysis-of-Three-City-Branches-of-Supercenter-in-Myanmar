## Project's Background

**Background:**

Supercenter, a leading retail giant in Myanmar, has consistently been at the forefront of meeting consumer demands. With three primary branches located in Yangon, Naypyityaw, and Mandalay, understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and operational efficiencies is pivotal for sustaining growth. This repository delves into a detailed sales analysis from January to March 2019, leveraging Tableau for data visualization.

**Problem Statement:**

With the rapidly evolving retail landscape, Supercenter seeks to discern key sales trends, customer preferences, and operational insights from its three branches. This analysis addresses:

- Determining which branch yields the highest revenue.
- Understanding the buying behavior between male and female customers.
- Evaluating the efficiency of different payment methods.
- Pinpointing peak shopping times.
- Gauging the popularity of product lines.
- Distinguishing buying behaviors of members vs. non-members.
- Identifying sales trends across all Supercenter branches.

## Datasets

**Dataset Overview:**

- Dataset Source: This dataset is obtained from the Kaggle public dataset
- This dataset contains information about sales in the three city-branches of Supercenter Mall, focusing on various analysis that could enhance its customer experience, optimize operations, and drive revenue growth.

## Objectives

- Data Preparation and Exploration: To clean and explore the dataset to understand the variables that influence customer churn.
- Predictive Modeling: To develop a classification model that can predict customer churn with an recall score of at least 80%.
- Clustering Analysis: To segment the customers predicted as 'Churn' into different clusters based on their characteristics.
- Retention Strategy: To propose targeted retention strategies for each identified cluster.
- Evaluation: To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the proposed retention strategies within a set timeframe (e.g., 3 months).
